# TODO

## During development

- [ ] Set up CI
  - [x] requirements.txt
- [ ] Set up CD
- [ ] LlamaIndex Integration; see Anyscale docs
- [x] FIXME: Can't polish sentences in mid of paragraph
- Use https://naturalnode.github.io/natural/Tokenizers.html

### Ideas

- [ ] CTRL + ENTER to polish entire paragraphs
- [ ] Run LLM (LangChain: has builtin vector db) in browser
- [ ] Any sentence split key like (.,;?!) triggers a new representation of the text in terms of sentences?

## For deployment

- [ ] Disable DEBUG mode
- [ ] `python manage.py collectstatic`
